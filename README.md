The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end Machine Learning project, including :
- extract tweets of specifics topics from Twitter, in real-time using Apache Kafka
- transform, using you trained-model for sentiments analysis classification
- load data into a data-warehouse using PostgreSQL
- real-time dashboard, to monitor the results for each topics using PowerBI (or equivalent)
Each parts can be start independently.

As twitter API not free to use, we go to reddit and work on it.
